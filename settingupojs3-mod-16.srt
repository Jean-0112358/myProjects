00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,090
Hello, welcome to module 16 of setting up
a journal with OJS 3.0 getting help.

2
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,870
We recognize that there's no way for us
to include all possible information into

3
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,430
our pkp school courses and this extra
module aims to help you discover the

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,699
different ways in which you can access
more detailed support as you develop

5
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:27,650
your journal with OJS 3.0. The first
recourse is embedded in your journal's

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,160
dashboard.

7
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,530
Most pages in the dashboard have a help
button.

8
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,420
Clicking on it will open a sliding
window with information about the page

9
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,680
that you are on and what you can do
there. If you scroll to the top, you'll

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,150
see you have access to a table of
contents.

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,970
This exposes all of the different help
pages embedded in the dashboard and you

12
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,400
can use the hyperlinks to look for
information that you need.

13
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,270
Or you can use the previous and next
buttons at the bottom of the page to

14
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,520
read through like a manual. This content
is sourced from the PKP documentation

15
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,720
Github and is updated in tandem with
software upgrades so should always be

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,270
current. If you require more in-depth
assistance, head to the PKP main website

17
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:29,009
pkp.sfu.ca. From the top navigation
you can see there is a link called

18
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,640
support.

19
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,020
Under it are the different places you
can look for further assistance.

20
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,380
The PKP community forum is a place where
you can ask questions and review

21
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,700
questions that have been post.

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,380
Here you can leverage the expertise of
the PKP community members. You're also

23
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,219
welcome to assist in answering questions
and to join in any of the forum

24
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,439
conversations. There is a specific area
for frequently asked questions, as well

25
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,400
as a dedicated questions sub-forum.

26
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,520
The documentation link leads you to the
PKP wiki page. The wiki is a web of

27
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,760
collected information sources. You can
use the search bar to look for something

28
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,569
specific, or you can dig around through
the descriptive links for a more organic

29
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:22,959
search.

30
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,800
PKP school is another source of
additional information.

31
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,990
Here you'll be able to find courses that
are similar to this one and that focus

32
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,990
on providing skills training for the
different roles within and OJS

33
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:41,980
installation. Finally, the education and
training link leads you to further

34
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:48,400
resources, particularly you'll find user
guides that can assist you in developing

35
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,060
your knowledge and understanding of
different facets of the public knowledge

36
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,030
project software suites.
And let's not forget that you're always

37
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,300
welcome to leave your questions in the
comments of this course and we'll do our

38
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,440
best to help you find the information
that you need. And that concludes our

39
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,060
course setting up a journal with OJS 3.0.
Thank you for watching and learning with

40
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,860
us and we look forward to reading your
journals.
