Hello, welcome back to module 10 of
setting up your journal with OJS 3.0.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,830
This is unit 3 of distribution settings
payments. If you would like to process

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,270
payments such as for subscription fees
or publication fees through your OJS

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,990
installation, that can be configured in
the payment section of distribution

5
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:28,150
settings. To access this section, login to
your dashboard through the top right

6
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,020
corner of your home page.

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,020
From the left navigation hover over
settings and select distribution.

8
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,260
Payments is the third tab in the new
frame.

9
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,680
Your first prompt is to select the
currency in which you'll be processing

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,180
the payments from a drop-down list.

11
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:04,339
Next use the payment method drop-down
menu to indicate whether payments will

12
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:09,940
be processed manually by your team or
will be processed through PayPal.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,670
If you select manual, a textbox generates
for you to explain payment instructions

14
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,600
to your readers and authors.

15
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:28,840
If you select PayPal, you are asked to
input your IPN URL and identify your

16
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,369
seller account. OJS has a PayPal
plugin that will facilitate PayPal

17
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:39,479
transactions from your website. Once
you've completed this page, click Save.

18
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:45,009
This feature can be added to your
journal or updated at any time. Thanks

19
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:48,960
for watching and we'll see you again in
the next module.
