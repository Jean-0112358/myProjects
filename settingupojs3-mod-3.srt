00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,390
Hello, welcome back to setting up a
journal with OTS 3.0. This is module 3

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,550
the reader interface. In this video I
will take you on a brief tour of what

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,990
your OJS publication will look like from
your readers perspective. We'll start on

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,810
the landing page and then move through
all the different sections so that you

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,560
can see what kind of information is
stored where, what your readers will be

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,380
able to access and how that access that
information. Let's dive in. The URL of

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,370
your journal leads to the splash page. As
you can see, there is a top-level

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,450
horizontal navigation bar that contains
the most important content access points

9
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,810
and a sidebar of more specialized
information. The main body of the page

10
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:52,950
populates dynamically with journal
issues as they are published. You can

11
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,590
also create permanent content such as
this welcome message.

12
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,530
The current tab will bring you to the
most recently published volume of your

13
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,460
journal. As you can see, this page
displays the volume and issue

14
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,380
information of the publication. The cover
image, if one exists, and access to the

15
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:22,870
content of the issue. The content of this
example issue is split into two sections,

16
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:29,660
articles and reviews. From this table of
contents, we can also see titles, authors

17
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:37,640
and different formats in which the
content can be accessed. Clicking on the

18
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,000
title of an article brings you to the
detail page where you'll see the

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,250
articles abstract and citation
information. By clicking on the format of

20
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,080
your choice you can also read the
article. Here's an example of the PDF reader.

21
00:01:53,659 --> 00:02:03,650
This article is also available in XML
and in HTML.

22
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:12,680
The archives tab provides access to all
previously published volumes of the

23
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,860
journal and a brief description of each
one. Clicking through on the issue will

24
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,460
bring you to that table of contents,
which outlines the contents of the issue

25
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:31,100
and provides access to that content. The
about tab, when clicked on, brings the

26
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:36,050
reader to a broad about the journal page.
The content of this page is entirely

27
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,440
publisher created and it can contain as
much or as little information as you'd like.

28
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,780
Hovering over the about tab opens a
drop-down menu listing other items that

29
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:55,939
may be of interest, including the
editorial team, submissions and contact.

30
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,680
The editorial team tab contains as much
or as little information as you decide

31
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,489
and is a space in which you can
introduce the members of your editorial

32
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:15,569
team. The submissions page gives general guidelines about making submissions to

33
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:23,459
the journal and is a portal that can be
used to make submissions. Contact

34
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,970
information contains the address of the
journal, information for the principal

35
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,480
contact of the editorial staff and
contact information for the journal web

36
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,920
instant support person. Finally, there is
a search bar which can be used to run

37
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,609
keyword searches for content on your
website. Clicking on your journal title

38
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:49,709
will bring you back to the splash page.
The content in the side navigation menu

39
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,949
is something that you will determine for
your journal and we'll look at that more

40
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:57,329
in module 8. This example contains the
information block which is a series of

41
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:01,109
short information pages tailored to the
interests of specific user groups as

42
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:08,540
well as information about PKP hosting
and a link to more information about OJS.

43
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,660
Nearly everything we've seen on the
website today is customizable and I'll

44
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,530
walk you through that process in the
subsequent modules. This concludes our

45
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,639
introductory tour of what readers
encounter when navigating around at OJS

46
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,389
publication website. Thanks for watching,
we'll see you again in the next module.
