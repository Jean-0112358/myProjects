00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,700
Hello, welcome to module 6 of setting up
a journal with OJS 3.0 user profile. In

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,170
this module, I'll be walking you through
how to configure your personal user

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,090
profile within the OJS dashboard.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,099
We begin on the journal homepage in the
top right hand corner. You can log in to

5
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:29,869
your account. If you are already logged
in, hover over your username and select

6
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:36,739
the view profile link. We land on the
identity tab. The mandatory fields of

7
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:40,309
this page are filled in using the
information that you input during the

8
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:45,230
creation of your user account. There are
options for more information though if,

9
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,610
for example, you have a middle name and
would like to include it, you can input

10
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,579
it here.
You can also include a salutation,

11
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,440
your initials, a suffix

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:04,840
if one applies and your gender identity.
Click Save when you have completed the

13
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,560
form.
Along the top navigation, select the

14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,220
contact tab.

15
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,650
Under the contact section, you can enter
your contact information. The only

16
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,580
required information is your email
address and your country, both of which

17
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,500
are information that we input during the
creation process. But you also have the

18
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,060
option to input your phone number,

19
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:39,490
an affiliation if you have one

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,880
and your mailing address if you so
choose.

21
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:09,040
Again, click Save when you're satisfied
with the form.

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,569
We'll next move on to the roles tab.

23
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,770
Under rules, you can see the rules that
have been assigned to your account. This

24
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,840
account is enabled as an author and a
reviewer but we can also enable it as a

25
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,470
reader.

26
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,660
If you have enabled that you are a
reviewer, make sure that you're reviewing

27
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,000
interests are entered into the field
down below.

28
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,540
When you are finished, click Save.

29
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,260
Well next move on to the public tab.

30
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,940
Under the public tab, you can build your
public profile. This profile will be

31
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,620
visible to the public on the journal
website. If you have an identifying photo

32
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,130
that you would like to have associated
with your account, you can drag and drop

33
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:09,080
the file into the section to begin
uploading. You can also click on upload

34
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:16,010
file to open a browser window. The bio
statement is a rich text editor and you

35
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,890
can populate it with whatever
biographical information you would like

36
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,690
to share with readers. Your profile will
be accessed by readers viewing your

37
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,470
articles, so biographical information
that helps support your expertise is

38
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,190
recommended.

39
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,890
If you have a personal website, enter the
URL

40
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:47,200
and if you have an orchid ID you can
enter it here. When you've completed all

41
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,430
the changes, click Save.

42
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,230
The password tab allows you to reset
your password if necessary, just enter

43
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:09,840
your current password, your new password, confirm it and click Save.

44
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,120
Under the notifications tab you can decide what types of submission event notifications

45
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,820
you will receive. With in the OJS system,
the default setting is that you will

46
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,639
receive notifications both in the
dashboard and via email. Personally I do

47
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,770
not like receiving email notifications,
so we are going to select do not send me

48
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:38,430
an email for these types of
notifications on each of the types. When

49
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,139
you've completed your settings, click
Save.

50
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:47,620
You have now completely configured your
personal profile within the OJS system.

51
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,999
You can always come back at any time and make further adjustments if necessary.

52
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:56,349
Thanks for watching, we'll see you next
time.
