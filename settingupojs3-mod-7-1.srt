Hello, welcome to module 7 of setting up
your journal with OJS 3.0 journal

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,260
settings. This section is quite large so
we've broken it down into multiple units.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,789
This first unit is the masthead. In the
masthead, we'll be inputting a lot of the

4
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,470
contextual metadata for your journal.
Let's dive in. We start back on the

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,510
journal homepage. Access your dashboard by hovering over your username and

6
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,500
clicking on the dashboard link from the
left navigation. Hover over the Settings

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,100
tab and select journal. The masthead is
the first tab under the journal settings.

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,329
The masthead is where we'll input the
consistent publishing metadata for your

9
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,920
journal. The required fields are the
journal name and journal initials. Fill

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,510
in your publication's full name. It will
appear in your website's header. The

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,549
journal initials serve an internal
function.

12
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,320
You can also add a preferred
abbreviation which will appear in your URL.

13
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,730
The name of your publishing body can be
input

14
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,080
into the publisher section.

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,830
If your journal has an ISSN,
that information can be input here. The

16
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:27,020
system validates ISSN so I'm not able to
input a false one. Journal summary is for

17
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,369
a brief description of your journals
publishing interests and purpose. For our

18
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:41,540
example, we'll plug in some simple
pre-selected text. The masthead section

19
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,350
of the page is a rich text editor where
you can introduce all of the people on

20
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:50,240
your journal team including your editors,
directors and other persons. You have

21
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,690
complete control over how this text
looks, what information you choose to

22
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,820
include and what level of detail suits
your purposes. This section populates the

23
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,270
editorial team page on your journals
website and will be viewed by the public.

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,840
I've created some sample text to help
give you an idea of what this could look

25
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:13,970
like. So as we can see, we have the title,
we have the name, we have their

26
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,080
affiliation and we have a specific
formatting that helps highlight that

27
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,150
each subsection is related to the title.

28
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:28,850
The about the journal section is another
rich text editor in which you can input

29
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,959
as much or as little information as best
suits your journal. The description of

30
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,380
the section makes suggestions as to what types of content you may want to include

31
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,940
in this section. If there are any
sections you'd like to include but you

32
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,959
are uninspired in drafting the content,
reviewing the OJS published journals for

33
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,220
inspiration or examples can be a big
help. The content input into this section

34
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,320
displays on your journal website and
populates the about the journal page. For

35
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,799
example purposes, here's what some of
this content might look like. This

36
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:05,299
example has a focus and scope for the
journal, information about the open

37
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:10,609
access policy, a copyright notice, a
privacy statement and some information

38
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:16,760
about sponsorship. Now that we've filled
in everything, click Save. The changes

39
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,269
will push through to your website
immediately. If you need to change, edit

40
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:24,530
or add information at any time, just come
right back to the masthead page and

41
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,730
follow the same steps. Thanks for
watching, we'll see you again in the next

42
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,970
module.
