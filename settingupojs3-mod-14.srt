Hello welcome to module 14 of setting up
a journal with OJS 3.0 the static pages

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,210
plug-in. Static pages are additional HTML
content pages that are not part of the

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,130
basic OJS package, but will become part
of your website if, for example, you

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,789
wanted to add an information page about
an upcoming conference, this tool would

5
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,830
provide you with the capability to do so.
To activate static pages, login to your

6
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,230

the tabs.

19
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,290

the text that will be used to create the

20
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,490
permanent URL of this page and we
recommend using, when naming, best

21
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,500
practices of a brief alphanumeric series
of characters in lowercase with no

22
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,000
spaces and no special characters.

23
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,900
The title of the page is what will
appear in your web browser tab or window

24
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:10,680
head and depending on the layout will
also appear at the top of the page.

25
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,070
The content box is a rich text editor
into which you can enter your page

26
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,210
content. Use the preview button at the
bottom of the page to view how your

27
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:24,400
content will look once published to your
web page.

00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:36,380
When you're satisfied, click Save

29
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,060

30
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,990
redirect you to the page on your website.

buttons. Pages can be added, edited and
