00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,360
Hello, welcome back to module nine of
setting up your journal with OJS 3.0.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,420
This is unit 2 of workflow settings
submissions. The submissions section is

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,599
where we'll configure and input
submission guidelines for authors,

4
00:00:18,599 --> 00:00:23,270
submission checklists, metadata
requirements and other related materials.

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,630
To access submissions head to your
dashboard using the link in the top

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,770
right corner of your home page.

7
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:39,080
Hover over settings in the left
navigation and click on workflow in the

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,920
extended menu.

9
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,879
Submission is the second tab along the
top of the new frame.

10
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:55,210
The first prompt is for author
guidelines. This is a section over which

11
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,979
you have complete content control thanks
to the rich text editing box.

12
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,129
Bibliographic standards formatting
requirements and timeline expectations

13
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:08,040
are some of the information elements
that would be appropriate here.

14
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,770
The submissions preparation checklist is
aimed at helping authors ensure that

15
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,450
everything the editorial team needs is
included in their submission. It is

16
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,680
pre-populated with default items, but
those items can be edited or deleted if

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,300
they are not relevant. To access those
features, click on the expansion arrow.

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,659
This exposes the edit and delete buttons.
You can also add items to the list using

19
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,509
the add item button in the top right
hand corner of the box.

20
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,210
The add item wizard only has one field,
which is a box in which you described

21
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,259
the new checklist item.

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,750
When you're satisfied click Save.

23
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,980
Notification of author submission allows
you to direct the system to email the

24
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,880
primary contact of the journal in
addition to emailing the author once the

25
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,960
submission is complete.

26
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,770
Submission metadata allows you to enable metadata fields that can be filled in by

27
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,220
the author at the time of submission as
well as to indicate whether this

28
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,420
metadata element should be a part of the
submission form. The advantage of

29
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,610
allowing your authors to complete the
metadata is accuracy and detail. The

30
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,160
disadvantage is potential
inconsistencies in terms throughout the

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,300
journal as you'll be using individual
free text rather than applying a

32
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,920
controlled vocabulary. Be sure to
consider your journals needs and goals

33
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,200
while making metadata element decisions.

34
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:59,120
Finally, we come to the privacy statement
it is pre-populated with a default text

35
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,900
but can be edited to fully and
accurately reflect your journals

36
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,200
policies. When completed, click Save.

37
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,099
Let's take a quick look at how the
changes we've made will look to authors

38
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:19,090
making submissions. At the top of your
window, click on view site.

39
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:26,580
On your homepage, hover over the about
link and select submissions.

40
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,560
First, we can see the submissions
preparation checklist which matches

41
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:42,450
exactly with what we saw in the
dashboard. Following is the author

42
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,880
guidelines.
You'll note that while I'm logged in

43
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,350
with my journal manager account, an edit
button is visible beside the different

44
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:55,760
information blocks on the page. Clicking
on this will bring us back to the

45
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,600
submissions page in the workflow
settings of the dashboard. We can also

46
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,530
access our author submissions page in
the dashboard which we discussed in

47
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,520
module 5 by clicking on either the
making new submission or view your

48
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,400
pending submissions links. Not visible on
this page is the submission metadata

49
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,470
section which impacts the actual
submission process within the dashboard.

50
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,700
This is discussed in more detail in the
editing a journal with OJS 3.0 course.

51
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,980
And that concludes our overview of
workflow settings for submissions. Thanks

52
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,930
for watching and we'll see you again in
the next module.
