Hello, welcome back to module eight of
setting up a journal with OJS 3.0. This

2
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,210
is unit two of website settings
information. We're still in the website

3
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,450
settings module on the dashboard and in
this unit we'll be looking at how you

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:23,240
can edit the targeted user content
contained in the information block. We

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,560
begin back on our journal homepage. If
you'll recall unit 1 of this module, one

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,430
of the settings we've manipulated was
the content of the sidebar. The content

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,280
block currently at the top of our
sidebar is called the information block

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,270
and it contains pages of targeted
information for readers, authors and

9
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,860
librarians. In this unit we're going to
go over how to customize the information

10
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:48,820
on these pages. In the top right corner,
access your dashboard.

11
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:56,890
Hover over settings in the left
navigation and select website.

12
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:04,310
From the tabs along the top of the page,
select the second tab information.

13
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,970
Editing the information section is very
straightforward. The section audience,

14
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,960
heads, the rich text editing boxes and
the boxes are pre-populated with a

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,360
default message aimed at the common
needs of that audience. If the default

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,990
text serves your purposes,
there's no need to make any changes. But

17
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,230
you are welcome to customize this text
or even replace it entirely if that's

18
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:30,119
what best serves your journal. The for
readers section discusses how readers

19
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,470
can create registered accounts and some
of the benefits of doing so. You'll want

20
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,380
to edit this text if your journal
requires reader accounts or

21
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,490
subscriptions to access your content. If
you're going to hyperlink from this page

22
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,100
to content elsewhere,
make sure you test the links.

23
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,520
The four authors section contains broad
information about submitting to the

24
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,330
journal. The default is fairly short
redirecting authors to the author

25
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,780
guidelines and relevant content we've
already input on two different pages of

26
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,500
the website. You can include more
detailed information here if you'd

27
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,490
prefer to. Just make sure to remember to
update any duplicated information on

28
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,390
this page if you make changes to this
content elsewhere on your website in the

29
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,620
future. The four librarian section
contains information about how

30
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,570
librarians can include your journal in
their catalogs and holdings. This is also

31
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,230
a great place to include information and
contacts for institutional subscriptions

32
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,300
if your journal requires subscriptions.

33
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:32,859
When you're happy with your content,
click save. Your changes we'll go live on

34
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:38,650
your website immediately. These pages can be edited or updated at any time.

35
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,599
Thanks for watching and we'll see you again in the next unit.
