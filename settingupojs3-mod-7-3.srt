Hello, welcome back to module 7 of
setting up a journal with OJS 3.0. This

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,779
is unit 3 of journal settings your
sections. Many journals publish different

3
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:19,609
types of content such as articles
reviews editorials and more. This unit

4
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:22,839
will help you create the working frames
for different sections you might publish

5
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:27,349
including naming, defining policies for
the section, setting word limits and

6
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:31,550
sliding section editors. In this module,
I'll walk you through the process of

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:38,120
creating a new section. To access
sections, we begin back on our website

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:45,950
and then access our user dashboard
through the top right corner. Hover over

9
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,650
settings in the left-hand navigation
menu and select journal.

10
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:55,480
Sections is the third tab in the journal
settings.

11
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,820
On this page, you'll see the list of
sections already created.

12
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,400
Clicking on the expansion arrow beside a
section name exposes the edit and delete

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,660
button. You can edit the parameters of a
section at any time or remove them

14
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,010
completely if they are no longer needed.
For our purposes today, I'm going to

15
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:20,810
delete the article section and together
we'll recreate it. To delete, hit delete

16
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,690
and then confirm if you hit delete by
accident, you can hit cancel. Let's create

17
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:35,090
a section by clicking on the link in the
right corner of the box. This brings up a

18
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:40,869
pop-up form. The required information is
the section name and abbreviation.

19
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:47,229
The title for the section we are
creating is articles. The abbreviation

20
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:52,929
we'll give it is ART. Section policy is
a statement that describes the scope of

21
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:56,979
the section and the type of submissions
that are appropriate. It should include

22
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:59,890
information about whether the
submissions to the section are

23
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,689
peer-reviewed, indexed and whether there
are any restrictions on who can submit

24
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:08,619
work to it. It can also include
guidelines for length and formatting

25
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:13,510
style. Word count allows you to set a
limitation on the abstract word length.

26
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:21,430
Entering a zero indicates that there is
no limit. If your journal uses review

27
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,400
forms they can be selected from the drop
down menu and apply it to the section.

28
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,590
Our journal currently does not have
review forms. Review forms are created

29
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:41,200
and discussed in module 9. The indexing
section allows you to opt out of some of

30
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,579
the OJS automatic functions. These will
apply to all items published within the

31
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:50,290
section. If your journal is not using
peer review on this section, which would

32
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,639
be the case for sections such as
editorials or book reviews, be sure to

33
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:01,630
check this box. The identify items box
allows you to apply descriptive keywords

34
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,900
to your section which helps with search
engine indexing.

35
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,820
Finally, in this last section you can assign section editors. Section

36
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,420
editors will oversee this specific
section and seperate submissions from

37
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:23,420
the section to publication. To assign an
editor, click on add item. The drop down

38
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,570
menu will populate with all user
accounts that have section editor roles

39
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:35,330
enabled for their accounts. Select the
appropriate person. If you'd like to add

40
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,460
a second editor, click on the add item
once more and repeat the process. When

41
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,690
you're satisfied with your work, click
Save.

42
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,990
Lastly, the order of your sections on
this page will be reflected in the table

43
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:52,690
of contents of your published journal. To
change the order, click on the order link.

44
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,740
You can now drag and rearrange the
sections as you please. When you're

45
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:03,830
finished, click done. And that concludes
module 7. We'll see you back to the next

46
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,760
module. Thanks for watching.
