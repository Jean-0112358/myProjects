00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,880
Welcome back to module nine of setting
up your journal with OJS 3.0 workflow

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,800
settings.
This is unit five of this module emails.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,650
OJS sends a number of emails during
various stages of the editorial workflow,

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,280
as well as other actions such as
registration and submission

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,240
acknowledgement. The settings of the
section allow you to edit the signature

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,350
attached to the email, as well as change
the default messages sent in each type

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,329
of email. To access emails, log in to your
dashboard using the login link in the

8
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,100
top right corner of your journal home
page.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:46,000
Hover over settings in the left
navigation and select workflow.

10
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:51,699
Emails is the fifth tab at the top of
the page.

11
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:56,019
The first item on the page is the
signature attached to automated emails.

12
00:00:56,019 --> 00:01:00,460
It has a default signature, but it is a
rich text editing box that can be

13
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,809
customized whatever you prefer.

14
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,950
Following, use the option to set a
bounce address. Any undelivered emails

15
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,940
will send an error message to this
address. Activating this feature will

16
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:18,160
requires some assistance from your site
administrator.

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,299
Finally we come to the email templates.
OJS 3.0 is preloaded with 62 templates

18
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:30,250
all arranged in the following table. Some
templates are essential and have their

19
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:35,319
enabled tick boxes greyed out. Others are
optional and can be disabled as that

20
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:39,369
serves here. Clicking on the expansion
arrow beside the template name allows

21
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:44,310
you to edit the email or reset it to its
default settings.

22
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,970
When editing emails, it's important to
note that the text in scroll brackets

23
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:01,010
are system commands that Auto generate content. When you've completed your edits,

24
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:10,340
click Save. To add a new template click
on the add email template link at the

25
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,880
top of the box.

26
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,040
The form requires a name subject and
body content. When you've completed the

27
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:28,020
form, click Save. When you're satisfied
with all of the changes that you've made

28
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,740
to your templates, scroll down to the
bottom of the page and click Save.

29
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:44,340
Email templates can be edited at any
time and the defaults can all be

30
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,109
restored at once using the reset all
templates button and that concludes our

31
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:52,799
overview of the email workflow settings.
Thanks for watching we'll see you again

32
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:55,519
in the next module.
