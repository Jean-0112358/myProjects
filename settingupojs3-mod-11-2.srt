Hello, welcome back to module 11 of
setting up a journal with OJS 3.0 users

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,610
and roles.
This is unit 2 of this module roles. User

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:21,090
roles govern who can access what in the
editorial workflow. OJS 3.0 provides a

4
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,630
flexible user role system that allows
you to tailor these roles to your

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,579
journals needs. To access rules, login to
your dashboard through the top right

6
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,750
corner of your journal home page.

7
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,910
Hover over users and roles and select
roles.

8
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:50,710
OJS is pre-loaded with 17 different roles
and they are listed in this table. The

9
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:56,210
table lists the roles by name and
abbreviation and then indicates the

10
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,790
different stage assignments that can be
activated for the role. This means that

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,920
users with, for example, the role of
journal editor are able to assign tasks

12
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,840
from all stages of production to
appropriate users. But the production

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,789
editor is only able to assign copy
editing or production tasks to the

14
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:21,319
appropriate users. They are unable to
assign tasks related to submissions or

15
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:26,929
reviews. To change these role based
abilities tick or untick the boxes

16
00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:30,950
related to the responsibility you wish
to change. Clicking on the expansion

17
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,819
arrow beside the role name exposes the
edit and remove buttons.

18
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,330
To edit a role, click Edit.

19
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:49,420
For existing roles, the permission level
will be grayed out and cannot be changed

20
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,920
through editing, but you are able to edit
the role name as well as the

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,310
abbreviation for the name.
Following is another opportunity to

22
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,950
adjust the stage assignment powers of
this role.

23
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,060
Finally you can indicate whether you
want this role title to appear in the

24
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,679
contributor list and whether you'd like
to allow users to self register for this

25
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,510
role as they can with readers and
authors. When you've completed your edits,

26
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,500
click OK.

27
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,930
In addition to editing existing roles,
you are also able to create new roles by

28
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:32,350
clicking on the create new role button
in the top right corner of the box.

29
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,440
When creating a role you are able to
select the ideal permission level. As we

30
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,070
saw while editing the roles, the
permission level becomes locked after

31
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,330
the role is created.

32
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,020
Following we see the same fields we
covered while editing roles. When you've

33
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,300
completed the form, click OK at the
bottom.

34
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,840
For more information about what
permissions are associated with each

35
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,890
role, click on the Help button at the top
right of the page.

36
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,140
Scroll down to the roll section.

37
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,410
A brief list of the different permission
levels can be found here. And that

38
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,550
concludes our overview of roles. Thanks
for watching and we'll see you again in

39
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,970
the next module
