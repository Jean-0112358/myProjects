Hello, welcome back to module eight of
setting up a journal with OJS 3.0. This

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:14,590
is unit four of website settings
languages. OJS 3.0 supports many

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,619
different publication languages and in
this unit I'll demonstrate how to

4
00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:23,019
activate them. To access language
settings and to your dashboard to the

5
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:26,789
top right hand corner of your journals
homepage.

6
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:36,730
In the left-hand navigation, hover over
settings and select website.

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,630
Languages is the fourth tab along the
top of the page.

8
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,150
The default language included in the
initial OJS installation is English.

9
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,360
Additional language packages must be
downloaded from the OJS website and

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,250
installed into your existing OJS system
by your site administrator. That work is

11
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,360
beyond the scope of this tutorial, but
I'll quickly show you what you can do as

12
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,250
a journal manager once the language is
installed. All languages that have been

13
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,810
installed will appear on this page the
primary locale radio button allows you

14
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,619
to set the default language of your
website. This is the language the page

15
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,630
appears in. UI stands for user interface
and selecting this option allows your

16
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,200
visitors to choose this language over
the default language when viewing your

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,450
webpage. If, for example, we had set
Portuguese as the primary locale, but

18
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,830
left English enabled as a UI language,
visitors to your website would be able

19
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:40,440
to toggle between the two languages.
Submissions refers to the language of

20
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,880
the submission page. Having more than one language enabled will allow authors to

21
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,099
choose which language the submission
page displays in. Forms refers to all the

22
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:53,880
different forms that are being used by
different roles in the editorial process

23
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,009
to accomplish tasks. Enabling the
language for forms will provide that

24
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,440
language option when using those forms.
Anytime new languages get added to your

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,340
installation or if the language
preferences of your journal change, you

26
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,140
can come back to this page at any time
and adjust your settings and preferences.

27
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,180
Thanks for watching and we'll see you
again in the next unit.
