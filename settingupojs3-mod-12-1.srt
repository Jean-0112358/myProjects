Hello, welcome module 12 of setting up
your journal with OJS 3.0 tools. This

2
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:16,600
module has two units and this video is
unit 1 import/export. The import/export

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,250
tools allow you to move content between
OJS installations you can import and

4
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,950
export users, publications and article
metadata. To access import/export, login

5
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:31,140
to your journal through the top right
corner of your journal homepage.

6
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:39,600
Hover over tools in the left navigation
and select import/export.

7
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,570
The frame you land on is a list of
different plugins installed in OJS

8
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,600
3.0 that facilitate data migration.
Each item is composed of a hyperlinked

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,510
title and brief description of what each
tool accomplishes. To use a tool click on

10
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,110
the hyperlink.

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,570
Each plugin looks a bit different. Some
will require some configuration such as

12
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,800
the data sight export registration
plugin. But clear instructions and

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,050
additional information is included in
the page to help you use the tool. Others

14
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:21,000
such as the public identifiers XML
plugin are already configured and can be

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,630
immediately used to export data from
your journal as well as to facilitate

16
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,240
the import of relevant data files. With
each tool simply follow the instructions

17
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,480
and prompts on the relevant page. Thanks for watching and we'll see you again in the next unit.
