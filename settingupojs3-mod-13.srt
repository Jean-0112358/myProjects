Hello, welcome to module 13 of setting up a journal with OJS 3.0 the Google

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,840
Analytics plugin. Google Analytics is one
of the optional plugins that you can

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,590
activate for your journal and connecting
your Google Analytics account through

4
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,310
your journal website will enable the
gathering of all kinds of use and visit

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,230
data on your journal. To activate and
configure the google analytics plugin,

6
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,410
log in to your dashboard to the top
right corner of the journal homepage.

7
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,699
Hover over settings in the left
navigation and select website.

8
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,290
From the tabs along the top of the new
frame, select plugins.

9
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,050
On the install plugins list, either used
the search to find Google Analytics or

10
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:00,280
scroll down to generic plugins in the
table and manually find Google Analytics.

11
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,829
In order to activate Google Analytics
within OJS, tick the box.

12
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:19,730
An expansion arrow is now visible beside
the plugin named click on it to expose

13
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,950
the plugin settings and click on
settings.

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,030
Before you can start using Google
Analytics on your home page, you must

15
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,020
first create a Google Analytics account.
If you have not already done so you can

16
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,430
click on the Google Analytics site link
to complete this step. Once you've got

17
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,360
your account setup, input your Google
Analytics account number into this box

18
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,070
and click OK to save your setup. Please
note that it can take up to 24 hours for

19
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,340
this update to push through onto the
website and for Google Analytics to

20
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,080
begin reporting data. And that concludes
our overview of the settings and

21
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,009
configuration of Google Analytics for
your journal. Thanks for watching and

22
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,330
we'll see you again in the next module.
