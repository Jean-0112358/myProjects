Hello, welcome back to module 11 of
setting up a journal with OJS 3.0 users

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,950
and roles.
This is unit 3 of this module slight

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,900
access options. Under the site access tab, you can turn off public user

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,689
registration or limit access to the
reader facing site to registered users.

5
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:28,619
To access site access options, login to
the dashboard through the top right

6
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,880
corner of your journal home page.

7
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,560
Hover-over users and roles in the left
navigation and select site access options.

8
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,200
Manipulating site access is very easy,
it's simply a matter of ticking or

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,550
unticking boxes to enable described
features. The first section of the page

10
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,750
defines two options for additional site
and article access restrictions.

11
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:00,430
You're able to select whether users must
be registered and logged in to view the

12
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:05,470
journal site meaning any content on your
website not just the journal issues as

13
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,229
well as select whether users must be
registered to view open access content.

14
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,910
You can select either both or neither
and you can change this at any date if

15
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:21,399
your journal changes its policies. The
second section is user registration For

16
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:26,830
this section, you must select only one
option. Option one, the default, is that

17
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:31,570
users can register a user account with
the journal. Option two is to have the

18
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,710
journal manager register all user
accounts with permissions to editors and

19
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,180
section editors to register a new
reviewer accounts. When you've completed

20
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,880
your modifications, click Save. And that
concludes this unit as well as concludes

21
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:52,050
module 11. Thanks for watching and we'll
see you again in the next module.
