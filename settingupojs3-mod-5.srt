00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:10,900
Hello and welcome to module 5 of setting
up a journal with OJS 3.0 user dashboard.

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,020
Most of the work we do in this course
takes place in the dashboard and it

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,070
contains many important sections and
elements. In this video, I'll introduce

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,470
you to those elements and give you a
general orientation to the interface. We

5
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:29,060
begin on the journal's main page. In the
top right hand corner, click on login and

6
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:37,400
enter the credentials for the account
you created in module 4. Logging in

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,390
redirects you to your account's OJS
dashboard which should look a lot like

8
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:46,340
this one at first. The dashboard is
composed of a thin static navigation bar

9
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,300
along the top of the page and a static
side navigation bar along the left that

10
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,230
create a frame around a dynamic window
with section tabs and content that

11
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,550
changes based on what part of the
dashboard you're looking at. We'll go

12
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,070
through the dashboard systematically,
beginning with the top navigation

13
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,930
options and then working our way down
through the left. In the top left, you'll

14
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,130
see the name of the journal for which
you've created this account. If you have

15
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,990
multiple journals, you can use the
expansion arrow to switch between them.

16
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,499
We next see the language of the page and
then a link to view the journal site.

17
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:25,840
This link redirects you to your journal
home page. Finally, there is the username.

18
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,520
Hovering over your name activates a
drop-down menu of options to view your

19
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:37,030
profile or logout. Click on view profile
this section is where you'll be able to

20
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,050
input and edit all of your private and
public personal information. This section

21
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:45,640
is covered in depth in module six. Note
the different tabs along the top of the

22
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,770
page that indicate different facets of
this section and the help button which

23
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:56,890
opens a side panel with information
about the page that you're on. Moving

24
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:05,920
along to the left sidebar navigation, our
first tab is the tasks tab. Clicking on

25
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,480
this opens a pop-up that lists all tasks
that have been assigned to you. We'll

26
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,470
cover what tasks are and assigning them
extensively in the editing a journal

27
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:20,050
with OJS 3.0 course, so I won't go into
detail on them here. Just know that if

28
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,950
you have them you'll be able to view
them here. You'll note that my tasks tab

29
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,380
currently has a 0 beside it,
but my pop-up shows an item. The number

30
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:36,370
indicates unread tasks. If I were to mark
the tasks as unread by selecting it and

31
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:45,880
clicking the mark new button, my tasks
number changes. I can also mark the tasks

32
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:54,610
as read or delete it. The submissions tab
is where you'll manage submissions to

33
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,750
the journal. This is another section that
is covered in depth in the editing a

34
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:04,959
journal course and it does not require
any setup. In brief, the my queue tab contains

35
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,160
all active submissions that are
specifically related to you. These can be

36
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,940
submissions you need to assign to a
member of your team, submissions that

37
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,020
have been assigned to you to complete a
task on and submissions that you may

38
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,310
have made to the journal that are being
processed.

39
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:28,950
You can create a new submission by
clicking on new submission. The all

40
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,270
active tab is only visible to editors
and administrators and allows me to find

41
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:39,370
any active submission in the system.
Archives show all articles that are no

42
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,850
longer in the editorial workflow, meaning
they have either been published or

43
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,330
declined.

44
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,110
The issues tab is another editorial
function that will be covered in the

45
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:56,030
editing a journal course.
This section has two parts. Future issues

46
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,400
is where editors create, manage and
publish in progress issues of their journals.

47
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,960
Back issues allows you to review and
edit issues that have been published.

48
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,460
Hovering over the settings tab expands
it into four sections. Each of these

49
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,790
sections are covered in different
modules of this course and most of the

50
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:22,130
work we will be doing in this course
happens under this tab.

51
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,300
Journal settings are the topic of module
7 and is where will input contextual

52
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,729
metadata to describe your journal and
its policies.

53
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,410
Website settings are the topic of module
8. This is where will customize the

54
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,460
physical appearance of your website
generate some content and explore some

55
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,540
other features that can be included in
your website such as archiving and plugins.

56
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,030
Workflow settings arecovered in module nine and this is the

57
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,000
section in which will configure the
editorial workflow of your journal

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,199
including file management, various
guidelines requirements and deadlines

59
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,449
for different roles as well as email
templates.

60
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,790
Distribution settings are the topic of
module 10 and contain settings related

61
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:18,320
to search engine indexing, payments
permissions and licensing details for

62
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,919
publication.

63
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,919
Users and roles is where you'll manage
registered accounts made for your

64
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,160
journal and the roles and permissions
associated with those user accounts.

65
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:37,040
This section is covered in more detail in
modules 11, 12 and 13.

66
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,300
The tools section is where you can
deploy certain plugins to pull different

67
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,800
types of data out of OJS as well as
where you can access embedded reporting

68
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,540
and statistics on your journal. These
topics will be covered in module 14 of

69
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,910
this course. And that concludes our
whirlwind orientation of the OJS 3.0

70
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,510
dashboard. As I'm sure you've noticed,
there are a lot of elements working

71
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,650
together within the system to accomplish
different functions. The modules of this

72
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,400
course reflect this interoperability by
building on each other as they walk you

73
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,270
through the step-by-step process of
developing your journal. Thanks for

74
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,980
watching and we'll see you again in the
next module.
