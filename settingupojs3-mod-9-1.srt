00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:09,570
Hello, welcome back to module nine of
setting up your journal with OJS 3.0

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,550
workflow settings. Workflow settings
allows you to configure all aspects of

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,210
the editorial workflow including file
management, submission guidelines and

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,960
requirements, peer review guidelines and
deadlines and email templates and

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,099
notifications. This is one of our larger
modules and we've broken it into

6
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:32,489
multiple units. This video is unit 1
components. Submissions to your journal

7
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:37,350
may be comprised of multiple parts or
components such as the article text and

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,790
related datasets. The components section of the workflow settings is where you'll

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,210
be able to manage what subscription
component types are supported by your

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,430
journal and can be included with
submissions. To reach components, we begin

11
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,760
on our journal website and access our
dashboard through the top right corner.

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,030
Hover over settings in the left
navigation bar and select workflow.

13
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:13,450
Components is the first tab in the new
frame and the page you land on. OJS has a

14
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,560
default list of possible components
pre-loaded into your dashboard and these

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,490
defaults can be restored at any time
using the restore default button. If

16
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,360
there are items in the list that are not
relevant to your journal, click on the

17
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,539
expansion arrow beside the item and
either edit or delete it.

18
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:40,399
If you're in need of a component type
that is not included in the default list,

19
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:46,030
you can add it by clicking on add a
component.

20
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,899
Acquired fields for adding a new
component type are the component name

21
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:56,320
and designation. Enter an appropriate
name.

22
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,850
Designation is a feature still in
development so for now just enter a

23
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,360
double hash.

24
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:11,320
More information will be released on
this feature in the future. Following

25
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,010
these fields are some additional options
you can activate for this component. If

26
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,100
appropriate, you can indicate that files
of this type are to be sorted by chapter.

27
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,590
Indicate that these files are independent from other published content

28
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:29,880
or indicate that these components will
always be supplementary files.

29
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,700
Finally, you can use the drop-down menu
to indicate the file type grouping of

30
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,660
this component.

31
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,050
When you're satisfied, click Save.

32
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,280
Once you've edited your components list
to only include components relevant to

33
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,350
your journal submissions, you can use the
order button to reorder the list. The

34
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,250
order is reflected on the submissions
page so it is best practice to place the

35
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,520
most frequently used components near the top of the list for ease of access.

36
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,930
When you're satisfied with your order,
click done.

37
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,379
That concludes our overview of the
components section of the workflow

38
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:19,829
settings. Thanks for watching and we'll
see you again in the next unit.
