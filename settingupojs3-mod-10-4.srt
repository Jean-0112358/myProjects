00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:09,190
Hello, welcome back to module 10 of
setting up your journal with OJS 3.0.

2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:15,070
This is unit 4 of distribution settings
permissions. In this section, we'll

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,789
configure settings around copyright and
licensing of materials submitted to and

4
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:23,290
published by your journal. To access
permissions, login to your dashboard

5
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,630
through the top right corner of your
journal home page.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:37,550
Hover over settings in the left
navigation and select distribution.

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,760
Permissions is the fourth tab in the new
frame.

8
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:51,780
The first section of the page is a rich
text editor for your copyright notice.

9
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,980
The copyright notice is meant to inform
regarding the underlying claim to

10
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,710
copyright ownership in a published work.
In other words, use this section to

11
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,060
inform those interacting with your
journal about who owns the copyright to

12
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,080
materials published in your journal.
If you require authors agree to the

13
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,320
copyright notice as part of the
submissions process, tick this box.

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,979
OJS will automatically generate
copyright notices on each item published

15
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,810
in your journal and the following two
items configure that setting. Firstly,

16
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,759
indicate whether copyright year is based
on the issue publication or the article

17
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,539
publication date.

18
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:42,630
Secondly, indicate who the copyright
holder of the materials will be.

19
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,050
Licensing differs from copyright because
it defines how material can be used

20
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:53,300
rather than who has legal ownership of
the materials. Using the drop-down menu,

21
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,380
indicate what type of usage license
should be applied to the materials in

22
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,490
your journal. The drop-down menu is
pre-populated with the different types

23
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,900
of Creative Commons licenses. But if you
are using a different license, select

24
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,590
other and provide a URL to the license
if one is available.

25
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,790
Finally, copyright and licensing
information is permanently attached to

26
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,050
your published content. If for some
reason you need to reset the stored

27
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,340
permissions to update information, you
can use the reset article permissions

28
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,540
button at the bottom of this page to
create a rollback across all

29
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:32,680
pre-existing content. When you've
completed the settings click Save.

30
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,670
This concludes our overview of the
different elements of the distribution

31
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:43,360
settings. Thanks for watching and we'll
see you again in the next module.
