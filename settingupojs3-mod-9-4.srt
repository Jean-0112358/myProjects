00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:08,720
Welcome back to module nine of setting
up a journal with OJS 3.0 workflow

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,000
settings.
This is unit four of this module

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,740
publisher library. The publisher library
provides a file repository for storing

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,730
and quickly sharing common files such as
writing guidelines, author contracts,

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:25,070
release forms, marketing materials. Items
that are stored in the publisher library

6
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,540
can be quickly retrieved and added into
a submission library to be shared with

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,680
authors and assistants. To access the
publisher library, we begin on the

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,920
journal homepage and then move into the
dashboards through the login link in the top

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,060
right corner of the page.

10
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:48,539
Hover over settings in your left
navigation and select workflow.

11
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,100
Publisher library is the fourth tab in
the new frame.

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,910
At present, our publisher library is
empty but you can see that the page has

13
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,390
some default categories that help
organize and sort documents as they are

14
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:09,310
added. To add a document, click on add
file in the top right corner of the box.

15
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,079
All three items in the wizard are
required items. Begin by naming your file

16
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:20,030
simple but descriptive titles are
recommended.

17
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,210
Next, choose the type which corresponds
to the sorting categories we saw on the

18
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,720
landing page.

19
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,800
Finally attach a file by either
dragging and dropping or clicking upload

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,970
file to open the wizard.

21
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:44,369
When finished, click okay.

22
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,600
You can now see the item has been added
to the library. Clicking on the

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,370
hyperlinked title will download the file.
Clicking on the expansion arrow exposes

24
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,630
the edit and delete button.

25
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:02,230
This page and its content can be edited
at any time. And that concludes our

26
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,160
overview of the publisher library. Thanks
for watching we'll see you again in the

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,550
next module.
