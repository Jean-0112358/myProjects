Hello, welcome to module 10 of setting up a journal with OJS 3.0 distribution

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,750
settings. This is another larger module
and we broken it down into multiple

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:19,810
units. This video is unit 1 indexing.
Distribution settings is where we'll

4
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,440
configure settings related to your
search engine indexing, any payments if

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,210
you'll be taking them and permissions
and licensing details for publications.

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,760
From your journal homepage access your
dashboard through the top right corner of the page.

7
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:41,140
Hover over settings in the left
navigation and select distribution.

8
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,250
Indexing is the first tab in the new
frame and the page that you land on.

9
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,660
Indexing refers to search engine
indexing and the elements will configure

10
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,930
in this page will affect how your
journal displays in search engine

11
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,820
results and influence how your journal
is indexed by those search engines. Our

12
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,900
first item on this page is the
description. This description displays

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,650
with a hyperlink to your website in
search engine results. Fill in the text

14
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:11,120
box with an appropriate and brief
descriptive statement introducing your journal.

15
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,500
Custom tags are the metadata that get
embedded in the HTML structure of your

16
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,440
journal. They are not visible on your web
page but are read by search engine

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,060
crawlers that index your page. The text
input here should use HTML syntax and we

18
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,690
recommend looking up the structure if
you're unfamiliar with it.

19
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:38,110
Search engine optimization can be a bit
tricky and so we also recommend

20
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,690
leveraging search engine optimization
best practices.

21
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,329
When you're satisfied with your content,
click Save.

22
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,200
This page can be edited and updated at
any time. Thanks for watching and we'll

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,190
see you again in the next module.
