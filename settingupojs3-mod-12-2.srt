Hello, welcome back to module 12 of
setting up a journal with OJS 3.0 tools.

2
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:16,190
This is unit 2 statistics. The OJS 3.0
system can be used to generate reports

3
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,450
that track site usage and submissions
over a given period of time. To access

4
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,110
statistics, log in to your dashboard
through the top right corner of your

5
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,770
journal home page.

6
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:34,579
Hover over tools in the left navigation
and select statistics.

7
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,640
OJS 3.0 has four basic reports that
you can export by clicking on the links.

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,800
To generate a custom report, click on the
generate custom report button and follow

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,379
the prompts to tailor the report. The
reports are generated in CSV format and

10
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:56,059
will require a spreadsheet application
such as Excel, Google Docs or LibreOffice

11
00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:02,720
to view and visualize. And that concludes
our overview of the OJS 3.0 tools. Thanks

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,729
for watching and we'll see you again in
the next unit.
