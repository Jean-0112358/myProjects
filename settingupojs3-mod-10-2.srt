Hello, welcome back to module 10 of
setting up your journal with OJS 3.0.

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,730
This is unit 2 of distribution settings
access. This is where you'll manage

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,590
access to the journal content. Access
your dashboard through the login link in

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,700
the top right corner of your home page.

5
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:31,900
Hover over settings in the left
navigation and select distribution.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,329
Access is the second tab in the new
frame.

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,970
This page is very simple, you just need
to use the radio buttons to indicate

8
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,060
whether the journal will be used to
openly publish the journals content

9
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:53,010
online or not. More nuanced restrictions
and limitations for access such as

10
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,870
delayed open access or subscription
access only are set elsewhere within the

11
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,800
different stages of the journal creation.
This configuration is for back-end

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,180
auditing and configuration purposes.

13
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,979
When your selection is made, click Save.

14
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:11,340
If your journals publication policies
change over time, you can always come

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,420
back to this page and change your
settings. Thanks for watching and we'll

16
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,530
see you again in the next module.
