Hello!

2
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,280
Welcome to the PKP Course: Setting up a Journal
with OJS 3.0, Module 1: Introduction.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,260
My name is Janna, and I'll be your guide through
this new version of Open Journal Systems.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,660
Before we get started, here are a few basics
that you should know.

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,869
Firstly, the course is free.

6
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:24,079
There are no fees to take any of the PKP School
courses.

7
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,699
There is a paid certification option, but
that is optional.

8
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:30,759
Secondly, the course is completely online.

9
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:33,670
Everything you need will be available in the
online modules.

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,770
Thirdly, the course is entirely self-paced.

11
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,480
You can move through the modules at your own
speed.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,519
And finally, the course is interactive.

13
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:45,800
Although registration is optional, doing so
will allow you to interact with me and other

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,329
students in the online discussions.

15
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:54,399
Each module will typically consist of a learning
objective, a video, some readings, an activity,

16
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,280
some discussion, and sometimes a quiz to allow
you to check what you've learned.

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,210
We hope you will find the course useful, and
we welcome on any feedback you have on how

18
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,790
to make it better.

19
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,540
Once you're ready, let's get started.
