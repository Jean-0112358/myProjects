Hello welcome to module 15 of setting up
a journal with OJS 3.0 custom blocks

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,799
with plugins. We covered content blocks
initially in module 8 unit one website

3
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:19,849
appearance and talked specifically about
the information content block in module

4
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:24,619
eight unit two. The content blocks are
content elements that appear in the side

5
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:29,720
navigation menu on your journal web site.
OJS 3.0 comes equipped with seven

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,710
different sidebar content blocks, but you
can create custom blocks if you need

7
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:39,230
them by using the custom block plug-in.
To activate this plugin login to the

8
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,110
dashboard using the link in the top
right corner of your journal home page.

9
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:52,750
Hover over settings in the left hand
navigation and select website.

10
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,739
In the new frame, click on plugins from
the tabs along the top of the frame.

11
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,619
The custom block manager plugin is an
installed plugin and it can be found on

12
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,490

search bar, or by scrolling down to the

13
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,259

22
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:15,269
Close the wizard by clicking on the X in

23
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,990
Let's look at website appearance
settings and see our new block.

24
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,970
You can see our new block has been added to the top of the sidebar and that

25
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,020
it's been annotated to indicate that it
is a custom block. To change its

26
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:44,350
placement in the sidebar, drag and drop
the block to your preferred location.

27
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,880
Scroll to the bottom of the page and
click Save.

28
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,300
Now let's take a look at how the block
on our sidebar. Click on view site at the

29
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,840
top of the dashboard.

30
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,920
Our custom block is there
in our sidebar, ready to be used by our

31
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,569
readers. And that concludes our overview
of the custom blocks plugin. Thanks for

32
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:16,280
watching and we'll see you again in the
next module.
