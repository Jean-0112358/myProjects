Hello and welcome to module four of
setting up a journal with OJS 3.0

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,700
registering and logging in. Registered
user accounts play a big role in OJS,

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,960
from higher level management right down
to casual readers and creating one is

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,789
your first step in taking on your role
in the journals publication cycle. Anyone

5
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:28,570
can create a user account and in this
video I'll walk you through creating yours.

6
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,820
We begin on the journal homepage, which
we explored in module 3. In the top right

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,380
hand corner, you can see two links to
register and to log in. If you already

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,130
had an account, you'd click on the log in
link, but we're going to create a new

9
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:50,989
account by clicking register. This brings
you to a fillable form. Simply follow the

10
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:57,010
field names to fill in the form. The red
asterisks indicate the mandatory fields

11
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,200
At the end of the forum, new users can
indicate whether they are interested in

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,869
acting as a reviewer for the journal.
Selecting this option generates a new

13
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:25,299
field to where you can indicate your
areas of expertise.

14
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,840
Click enter after you complete each
keyword phrase to generate a new term box.

15
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:46,220
When you finish completing your
reviewing interest, click register.

16
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:54,850
Congratulations! You've created a new
account. The new page will indicate that

17
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,359
your registration is complete and you
can see that the top right-hand corner

18
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:02,170
content has changed to reflect your
username indicating that you are

19
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,729
currently logged in. This page also
begins listing actions you can now take

20
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:10,149
with your registered account. These
actions will be explored in later

21
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:15,629
modules. Thanks for watching and we'll
see you again in the next module.
