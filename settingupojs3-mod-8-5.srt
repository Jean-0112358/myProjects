Hello, welcome back to module eight of
setting up a journal with OJS 3.0. This

2
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:14,990
is unit five of website settings
plugins. OJS 3.0 supports a huge number

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,470
of plugins to help customize your
journals features. In this unit, I'll

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,950
demonstrate how to activate desired
plugins and tell you a little bit about

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:28,340
some of the most commonly used plugins.
To access your website plugin gallery, go

6
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:33,160
to your dashboard through the link in
the top right corner of your home page.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,190
From the left-hand navigation, hover over
settings and select website.

8
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:51,280
Plugins is the fifth tab of the website settings section.

9
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,770
The plugins tab is split into install
plugin and the plugin gallery. Install

10
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,519
plugins are all plugins that are
embedded in the default OJS installation

11
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,770
and will also contain any further
plugins you decide to add. Let's begin by

12
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,729
exploring this page.

13
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,330
The install plugins are sorted into
categories to help make it easier to

14
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,830
find what you're looking for. The table
displays the name of the plugin, a brief

15
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:25,180
description and a checkbox indicating
whether or not the plugin is currently

16
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,460
enabled. Some plugins are essential to
the running of OJS and you'll see that

17
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,780
those ones are enabled and greyed out so
you're unable to accidentally disable

18
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:41,910
them. Other plugins, you'll be able to
enable or disable as suits you.

19
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:49,690
The block plugins section, for example,
mirrors what we set as our website

20
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:55,060
sidebar back in unit 1 of this module
website appearances. This is the back end

21
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,180
way of enabling or disabling those same
content blocks.

22
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,600
Further down the page we'll find other
common plugins that have been enabled

23
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,540
for your site, but that you could disable if you chose to.

24
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,230
Some useful plugins you may want to
consider enabling include the orchid

25
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,180
profile plugin and the google analytics
plugin, both of which are located in the

26
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:31,870
generic plugins section of the page. We
highly recommend taking your time going

27
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,560
through this page and taking advantage
of the plug-in options to customize and

28
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,520
enhance your journal.

29
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,400
Should you discover there's a feature
you need that isn't already installed in

30
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,540
your OJS instance, head over to the
second tab on this page the plugin

31
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,840
gallery.

32
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,890
In this gallery, you can find additional
plugins that could be installed on your

33
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,420
journal. Again, I encourage you to explore.
If there are any plugins that look

34
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,640
promising, click through on the hyperlink
names and follow the instructions. That

35
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,030
concludes our overview of the website
plugins. Thanks for watching and we'll

36
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,080
see you again in the next module.
