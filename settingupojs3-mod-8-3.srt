Welcome back to module eight of setting
up a journal with OJS 3.0. This is unit

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,309
three of website settings
archiving your website content. This unit

3
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:19,550
is very quick so let's just dive right
in. On your website access your dashboard

4
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,380
from the top right hand corner of the
page.

5
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:30,400
Hover over settings from the left
navigation and select website.

6
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:39,160
The third tab along the top of the page
is archiving.

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,440
OJS 3.0 has embedded locks and clocks
compatibility and if you wish to use

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,350
either of these networks to help with
long-term preservation of your journal,

9
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,540
you can enable it here. Both systems
require you to follow steps outside of

10
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,890
the OJS dashboard. Hyperlinks leading you to those outside communities and

11
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,750
instructions are provided here. All you
have to do within the OJS dashboard is

12
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,300
tick the enabling boxes and click Save.

13
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,509
Remember this step alone does not enroll
your journal in either the locks or

14
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,500
clocks networks, it just enables the
networking within your journal. Be sure

15
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,229
to follow through on joining the
preservation networks by clicking

16
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,960
through to their community websites and
following their instructions and

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,560
guidelines. Thanks for watching, we'll see
you back in the next unit.
