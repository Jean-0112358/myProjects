00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,680
Hello, welcome back to module eight of
setting up your journal with OJS 3.0.

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,240
This is unit six of website settings
announcements. Announcements are

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,450
temporary content that will appear on
your journals homepage. They are great

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,419
for content such as opening and closings
of submission requests for special

5
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:22,960
issues, event announcements and other
exciting changes happening in your

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,539
journal. To post an announcement, we begin on our website's main page and access

7
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:32,640
the dashboard through the top right
corner of the page.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,320
hover over settings in the left hand
navigation and select website

9
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,989
announcements is the last tab on the
website settings page.

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,400
The first thing you're prompted to do is
to enable announcements. To enable

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,040
journal managers to post announcements, tick the box.

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,300
If you'd like announcements to display
on your website's homepage, tick the box

13
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:07,230
and set the number of announcements that will display simultaneously on that page.

14
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,270
Enabling announcements creates a new
page that will contain the archived

15
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,470
announcements and only the most recent
announcements to the the number limits set

16
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,490
here will appear on your home page. If
you have any information about

17
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,490
announcements that you would like to
have displayed on your announcement page

18
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,420
such as perhaps a statement on who to
contact with questions about

19
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,790
announcements, you can enter it into this
text box. Let's enter some test content

20
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,820
so that we can see how it will display
when we view it from the website.

21
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,220
If you'd like to add index and control
to your announcements, you can use the

22
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:52,010
announcement type feature to create type
classes. This feature helps group

23
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,300
announcements for easy search and review in the future. Let's make some sample

24
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:03,100
types to see this feature in action.
Click on add an announcement type.

25
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,800
Enter a name for your type and click
Save.

26
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,900
After you've saved, you can use the
expansion arrow beside the type name to

27
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,190
either edit or remove it.

28
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,269
The final section is where you'll write
your announcements click on add

29
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:35,670
announcement to bring up the creation
wizard.

30
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:42,060
Select your announcement type from the
drop down menu and then follow the forum prompts.

31
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,870
The short description is the content
that will appear with the title on your

32
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,660
main page and on your archived
announcements page.

33
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,300
Description is the full text of the
announcement which is only seen after a

34
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,050
reader clicks through on the
announcement. The short description will

35
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:11,030
not appear in the description text after
a reader clicks through. The idea is that

36
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,230
the short description is a summary of
the full description, providing a brief

37
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,580
overview while the full description
provides the same information in greater detail.

38
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,160
If you want your announcement posted for a limited time, click on the expiry date

39
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,160
field and select an end date for the
announcement.

40
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:42,230
When that end date is reached, the
announcement automatically disappears.

41
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,239
To keep an announcement indefinitely, leave this field blank. Click Save when you've

42
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,049
completed the form.

43
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,269
As you add announcements, the
announcement box populates in reverse

44
00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:00,480
chronological order and indicates the
announcement title type and date posted.

45
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,640
Clicking on the title allows you to view
the announcement.

46
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,140
Clicking on the expansion arrow beside
the title allows you to edit or remove

47
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,140
announcements.

48
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,760
Click Save again at the bottom of this
page.

49
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,560
Let's take a look at how the
announcement displays on our website,

50
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,930
by clicking view site at the top corner of
our browser.

51
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:34,360
Firstly, notice that announcements has
been added to the top navigation bar of

52
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,790
our website.
As for how announcements display on the

53
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,920
homepage, it depends on which layout
you're using. In this instance, we can see

54
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,000
that the announcements display
underneath our permanent content but

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,630
above the most recent current issue of
our journal. As for what part of the

56
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:58,170
announcement displays you'll, see here it
is the brief description. If we click

57
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:03,570
through, you can see it is the full
description. Let's take a look at the

58
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,260
announcement page.

59
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,290
The active announcements are displayed
from most recent to least recent and are

60
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,490
listed with their titles and brief
descriptions. If we click through to the

61
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,949
full description, we can see that the
brief description is not included on the

62
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:26,030
page we redirected to. Which is why it's
important to make sure that all vital

63
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:31,970
information is repeated in both the
descriptions. And with that we conclude

64
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:37,690
module 8. Thanks for watching and we'll
see you again in the next module.
