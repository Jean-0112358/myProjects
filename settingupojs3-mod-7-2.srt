Hello, welcome back to module 7 of
setting up your journal with OJS 3.0.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,030
We're continuing with unit 2 of journal
settings contact. This unit is where we

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,090
will set up the contact information for
your journal. It's very straightforward

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:25,020
and will be very quick. Let's dive in. To
edit the journals contact information,

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:32,669
begin on the home page. Access your
dashboard, hover over settings and select

6
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:41,010
journal. Contact is the second tab along
the top of the new page. In the contact

7
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,030
tab, we're going to input our journal
contact information. The OJS system

8
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,690
requires a mailing address for the
journal, the name and email address of

9
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,990
the journals principal contact and the
name and email address of the journals

10
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,489
technical support contact. The mailing
address has minimal formatting control

11
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,850
so you can write it out as one line or
give it line breaks to help make the

12
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,840
information clearer.

13
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,650
The principal contact is the person at
your journal who is responsible for

14
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,759
corresponding with your readers and
potential authors. This is typically an

15
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,100
editor-in-chief, the assistant editor or
another person with a title in your team.

16
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,310
Their name and email address are
required information, but you can also

17
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:27,450
add their title, phone number and
affiliation if you choose. The technical

18
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,630
support person is the person on your
team that can help registered users

19
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,950
accomplish tasks within the OJS
interface. Their role is about the system

20
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,970
and infrastructure rather than the
intellectual content of the journal.

21
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,270
Enter their name and email address.
Optionally, you can also add their phone

22
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:51,330
number. Be sure to click Save when you're
done. This page populates the content in

23
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:56,340
the about contact section of your
website. And that's it for this unit.

24
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,229
Thanks for watching, we'll see in the
next one.
