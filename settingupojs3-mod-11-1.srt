00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:10,490
Hello, welcome to module 11 of setting up a journal with OJs 3.0 users and roles.

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:15,060
As a journal manager, you're able to
manage user accounts that have been

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,439
created for your journal including
creating new accounts, merging accounts,

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:26,400
adjusting roles, adjusting permissions
and removing accounts. This module has

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,359
been divided into three units. This video
is unit 1 users. To access users and

6
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,539
roles, login to your dashboard at the top
right corner of your home page.

7
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,870
In the left navigation, hover over users
unrolls

8
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,070
and select users.

9
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,960
This page is a table of all of the user
accounts that have been created for your

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,000
journal. It lists the basic information
of first and last names, user names and

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,860
email addresses. If you're looking for a
specific user, you can use the search

12
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,520
feature. This allows you to look up a
user using any of these details. You can

13
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,940
also limit the search based on the roles
associated with the accounts.

14
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,810
Roles will be discussed in more detail
in unit 2 of this module. Beside the

15
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,730
search bar is an add user button.

16
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,000
Clicking on this opens a wizard to
create a new user account. The mandatory

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,229
fields are the same mandatory fields we
set when creating our personal user

18
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:43,460
accounts back in module 4 registering
and logging in.

19
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,020
I'll see administrator creating an
account on behalf of the user.

20
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,800
You have the option to generate a random
password for this user as well as to

21
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,600
indicate that the user must change their
password upon their next login. You can

22
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,640
also elect to send the new user a
welcome email. Under more user details

23
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,160
you'll find optional user profile
details.

24
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:27,049
When you finish the form, click okay.
Whe wizard will then update and prompt

25
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:31,250
you to attach rules to this new account.
Different roles come with different

26
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,390
permissions and assigning or removing
them will change what dashboard elements

27
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,590
the user has access to and what tasks
within the editorial and publishing

28
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:45,680
process can be assigned to this user. To
add a role, click add role and select the

29
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,540
appropriate role from the drop down menu.

30
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:05,170
When you've added all of the necessary
roles, click OK.

31
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,850
Back on the users table, clicking on the
expansion arrow beside the username

32
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:16,400
exposes several tools that can be used
to manage the user account.

33
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,500
Firstly, you can click on the email
button to open an email wizard if you

34
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,580
need to contact this user.

35
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:31,129
Simply enter the subject and body and
then click send. You'll note that the two

36
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:37,460
fields populates automatically with the
email address stored in the user account.

37
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:43,140
Secondly you can edit the user account
by clicking on the edit button.

38
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,470
You're able to make changes to the
person's name, contact information and

39
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,190
password.

40
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,780
If you're setting a temporary password
for them, you can indicate that the user

41
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,950
must change their password on their next
login. You can additionally make changes

42
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:06,970
to their country and if you click on the
more user details expansion button,

43
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,240
you can also change nearly all the
details we adjusted while setting up our

44
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,700
personal user accounts back in module 6
user profile. As the journal manager, you

45
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:24,389
have the capability to access and change
all registered user profiles.

46
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:31,009
Following, you'll be able to see, and if
necessary, adjust the roles associated

47
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:36,530
with this account. To remove a role, click
on the X beside the role designation in

48
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,699
the right corner of the row.

49
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:47,030
To add a roll, click on add roll at the
top of the box. Using the drop down menu,

50
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,770
select the roll you wish to add from the
available options. Enabling the

51
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,270
appropriate rolls activates the account
to be assigned to certain tasks in other

52
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:01,940
areas of the journal such as section
editors or reviewers. When you've

53
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,860
completed your edits click OK.

54
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,880
From the same list of expanded
management options, you're able to both

55
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,370
disable or fully remove a user account.

56
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,670
Disabling the user will open a prompt to
requesting the reason. Enter an

57
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:28,790
appropriate explanation and click OK. On
a disabled user, the expanded menu shows

58
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:34,040
an enable button instead of a disabled
one. Click on it to re-enable the user,

59
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,800
entering the reason once more and
clicking OK.

60
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:45,040
To remove a user, click remove and then
confirm the action. When you're logged in

61
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,790
as a journal manager and view an account that is not your own, you have the

62
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:54,400
ability to log in as that user. This
feature allows you to complete actions

63
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,470
on behalf of that user as well as to
view the site through their roles.

64
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:03,760
Finally, you're able to merge accounts.
This feature is useful if a user

65
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,410
accidentally creates more than one
account among other reasons. To merge

66
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,600
accounts, click on the merge user button.

67
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,920
You will be asked to confirm that you
wish to merge this account with another.

68
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:24,340
Click OK.
The wizard will close as the page refreshes.

69
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,210
The account you are merging no longer
has a merge button and if you click on

70
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,130
the expansion arrow beside a second
account,

71
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,850
you'll see that the merge button has
changed into merge into this user. The

72
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,510
account we select first is the account
that will be sublimated, while the account

73
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,620
that we select second will become the
permanent account. To complete the

74
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,590
account merge, click on merge into this
user

75
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,460
and confirm.

76
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,790
And that concludes our overview of the
user section of users and roles. Thanks

77
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,710
for watching and we'll see you again in
the next module.
