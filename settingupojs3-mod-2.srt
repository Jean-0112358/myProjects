Hello, welcome back to Setting Up a Journal
with OJS 3.0.

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,700
This is module 2, Background on the Public
Knowledge Project and on the Open Journal

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,360
System.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,560
As you work through the course, this material
will help you understand a little bit more

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,000
about what we're about and some of the things
we're working on.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,699
PKP was founded in 1998 by Dr. John Willinsky,
then a professor at the University of British

7
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:30,600
Columbia in Canada.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,120
It continues to this day as a non-profit,
university-based initiative doing research

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,010
and development in scholarly publishing, with
its research home base at Stanford University

10
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,230
in the United States and its operations and
software development home at the Simon Fraser

11
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,190
University Library in Canada.

12
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,460
From the beginning, Dr. Willinsky was researching
how to better connect the general public to

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,050
the knowledge that is created at universities,
and quickly realized that online articles

14
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,519
are not freely available without library access.

15
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:06,020
This made demonstrating the value of university
research to the public very difficult.

16
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,940
As a result, in 2001, he created Open Journal
Systems as free, open source software for

17
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,090
publishing journals.

18
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:19,100
The goal was to build a software application
that would make publishing articles so efficient,

19
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,340
that they could be shared for free, among
researchers, but also with the general public.

20
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,430
If you aren't familiar with the unique characteristics
of open source software, we've included some

21
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,890
material in the readings to provide some further
information.

22
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,689
Basically, it is software that is free to
download, use, and revise for everyone.

23
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:42,210
OJS provides a web site for a journal, as
well as a system for online submissions, peer

24
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,800
review, editing, and publishing.

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,420
It keeps track of every step of the workflow,
provides automatic notifications and email-based

26
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,010
communication, and interoperates with many
other publishing systems, such as LOCKSS for

27
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:59,840
digital preservation, Crossref for Digital
Object Identifiers, Dataverse for data management,

28
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,930
ORCID for author identifiers, and more.

29
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:10,860
As of 2016, over 10,000 journals from over
100 countries now use OJS for publishing,

30
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,480
almost all of which are open access.

31
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,440
OJS has been translated into multiple languages,
and many OJS journals are hosted at academic

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,820
libraries.

33
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:27,430
PKP recently released version 3.0, the latest
and most advanced version of the software.

34
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,169
This course will be focused on this new version
of OJS.

35
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:36,760
For more background on PKP and OJS, check
out the reading list in this module.

36
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,500
If you have any questions, please post them
in the discussion area below.

37
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,580
Thanks for watching and see you again soon.
