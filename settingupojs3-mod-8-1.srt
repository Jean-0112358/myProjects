00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:09,719
Hello, welcome to module 8 of setting up
a journal with OJS 3.0 website settings.

2
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,740
As the section is quite large and can
get complex, we've broken it down into

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,640
six units that correspond to the six
tabs we'll see in the website settings

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,689
section of the dashboard.
This video covers unit 1 website

5
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,710
appearance. I will walk you through all
of the ways you can begin to customize

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,220
the look of your journal website and
provide you with a brief introduction to

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,510
some of OJS 3.0 available templates,
including the new bootstrap 3 base

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:40,320
themes. Let's get started. We begin on the
journal home page and access our user

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,880
dashboard from the top right corner.

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,250
Hover over settings and select website.

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:56,010
The first tab is appearance and this is
where we'll modify and adjust all visual

12
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:02,370
aspects of our journal. First, let's
upload a logo by clicking upload in the

13
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,020
pop-up window. Either drag and drop your
local image or click upload a file and

14
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,800
select your logo.

15
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,850
You are also prompted to add alternative
text to your image. Alternative text is

16
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,690
particularly important for communicating
the content of the image in the event

17
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,290
that the image doesn't load. It also
helps describe images to anyone

18
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,280
navigating your site with the help of a
text reader software. When you're

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,630
finished, click OK.

20
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:38,840
We can now see the image we've uploaded and it's related metadata. This logo will

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,260
now appear in the header of your website.
I'll point it out later in the video

22
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,600
after we save and view our changes on
the site.

23
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,200
The next section is a rich text editor
box that allows you to crop the footer

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,829
of your website. Let's add a bit of
simple text so that we can get a visual

25
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:59,710
sense of what this content looks like
when viewed on the website.

26
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:09,740
Now we'll select the theme. OJS 3.0
has three prepackaged themes. For now,

27
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,660
let's stick to the default theme. You can
now select the font style that will be

28
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,730
used in the website. For simplicity, I'm
going to use in Noto Sans, but I

29
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,920
encourage you to explore and select your
favorite.

30
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,349
You can also choose the header banner
color.

31
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,980
If you know the hex value of your
preferred color, you can input it into

32
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,220
the box.

33
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,890
You can also drag the gradient bar

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,420
and select a color. Different web
browsers and screens have different

35
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,080
capabilities when it comes to color
display and we recommend going through

36
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,099
the hex code of colors that have been
identified as optimal for websites in

37
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:05,790
order to ensure a consistent visual
experience for all of your visitors.

38
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:12,080
If you have an experienced web developer
working on your team, you are welcome to

39
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,230
leverage their expertise and upload
custom CSS files using this wizard.

40
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,220
Sidebar management allows you to change or reorganize the content that appears on

41
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,750
the journals side navigation bar. The
sidebar list indicates what is currently

42
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:32,150
in the sidebar and the order in which it
appears in the sidebar. The unselected

43
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:37,010
list has content that is not currently
in the sidebar, but could be added. To

44
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,450
change the sidebar content, just drag and
drop the content boxes into the column

45
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:47,570
and order you prefer. Moving all of the
items into the unselected will remove

46
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,620
the sidebar altogether.

47
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,030
Homepage image allows you to add an

48
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,600
image to be featured prominently on your
home page. It will be the first thing

49
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,350
that appears in the body of the home
page. Click upload and either drag and

50
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,760
drop or select the file.

51
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,910
If your journal has a favicon it can
be uploaded here and will appear in web

52
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,410
browser navigation bars and in tabs
beside your journal name. If there is any

53
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,640
permanent content you would like to have
appear on your journal homepage such as

54
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,970
a welcome message or a brief
introduction to the journal, you can

55
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,820
input it into the additional content
rich text editor.

56
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,650
Under lists, you can set and adjust
limits to the amount of information

57
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:58,110
items a page will hold before creating a
second page of content. Finally, if you

58
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,980
have a small version of your logo, you
can upload it as a thumbnail. This

59
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,690
thumbnail will be used by lists such as
the PKP index alongside your journals

60
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:12,000
description which is something that we
created back in module 7. When you're

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,920
satisfied with your changes, click Save.

62
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,069
Now let's view our journal and see how
the changes have manifested in our

63
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:31,129
websites appearance. Firstly, you can see
the changed banner color and the added

64
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:36,349
local image to our websites header. Our
sidebar also has some significant

65
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:44,349
changes. In our home pages body, the first item that we see is the home page image.

66
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,669
Near the bottom of page, we can see the
content that we set in the additional

67
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:58,699
content section. Finally, we see the
footer that we saved. Now let's head back

68
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:03,099
to the dashboard and take a look at some
of the other theme options.

69
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:14,580
From the themed drop-down menu, select
bootstrap base 3 theme. A new menu of

70
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,240
themes should appear under the drop down menu. But if for some reason it doesn't,

71
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,860
click Save at the bottom of the page and
then refresh. We won't go over all of the

72
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,130
different bootstrap theme options, but
there's a lot of variety between them

73
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:30,000
and I encourage you to explore and test
them out. Let's take a look at the

74
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,920
default bootstrap theme. We'll keep all
the other elements we set previously so

75
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,530
that we can compare how they get
rearranged in the new theme.

76
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,730
Click Save at the bottom of the page

77
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:52,660
and then on view site. All the elements
we set and the appearance are still

78
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:58,200
there, but this layout gives your page a
totally different look and feel.

79
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,669
And that concludes our walkthrough of
website appearance. We highly encourage

80
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:10,350
you to explore this section and
experiment with the different elements.

81
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:14,460
There are many ways to personalize your
journals and to help it look its best.

82
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,320
Thanks for watching and we'll see you
again in the next unit.
