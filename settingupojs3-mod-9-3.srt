00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,580
Welcome back to module nine of setting
up a journal with OJS 3.0 workflow

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,260
settings.
This is unit 3 of this module review.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,070
This section controls the parameters of
the submission review process, including

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,330
deadlines, forms, peer review parameters
and guidelines and policies regarding

5
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,560
competing interests. The review
guidelines are not visible on the public

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,789
website and are used by editors and
reviewers working on submissions within

7
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:35,350
the dashboard. That process is discussed
in detail in the editing a journal with

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:41,380
OJS 3.0 course. Let's take a look at
setting up these features. To access the

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,410
review settings page, go to your
dashboard using the link at the top

10
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,700
right hand corner of your page.

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,660
Hover over settings in the left hand
navigation and select workflow.

12
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,870
Review is the third tab along the top of
the new window.

13
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,870
Your first prompt is regarding the
setting of review deadlines. You can

14
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,590
choose to set a time limit defining how
many weeks a reviewer has to either

15
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,480
accept or decline a request to review a
submission and how many weeks they have

16
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,620
to complete their review of that
submission. If you choose to add limited

17
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,910
timeframes be sure to include them in
the review guidelines below so that your

18
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:31,490
reviewers are aware of these policies
and deadlines.

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,360
Following, you have the ability to set
automated email reminders. We'll talk

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,920
about the content of these emails in
module nine unit five. Automated

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,940
reminders require some configuration by
your site administrator. But once the

22
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,990
task is completed, these grayed out boxes
will be active and you can use the

23
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,750
drop-down menus to select the reminder
email schedule.

24
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:02,200
Review forms are used by reviewers to
help structure their feedback on

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,969
submissions forms are entirely in the
control of journal managers and are

26
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:12,160
created in a two-step process, beginning
with create review form in the top right

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,819
corner of the box.

28
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,950
Give your new form a title and then
complete a brief description and

29
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,050
instructions for use. click Save.

30
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,180
To add items to your form, click on the
expansion arrow beside the title and

31
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,900
click Edit.

32
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:47,110
In the pop-up wizard, the data we just
entered in the create window will all be

33
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,120
located in the first tab. It can be
edited here as well click on the second

34
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,350
tab form items.

35
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,110
In this section, we'll create items to be
included in the form by clicking on

36
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,280
create new item.

37
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,849
The rich text editor gives you lots of
space and flexibility in crafting each

38
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:10,780
of your form items.

39
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,190
After you define them, you have the
option to make this items completion a

40
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,450
required action. You can also elect to
inform the submission author through an

41
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,860
automated email if this form is going to
be used to review their submission. Item

42
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,820
type refers to the kind of response the
reviewer will be able to make to this

43
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,310
checklist item such as to enter a short
text blurb or tick a box. Using the

44
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,300
drop-down menu, select the item type that
facilitates the appropriate response to

45
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,260
your checklist item.

46
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,920
If you want your reviewer to select a
response from a list of preset options

47
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,990
such as to select whether the submission
is ready for publication, needs to be

48
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,820
revised or should be rejected, you can
set these options using the response

49
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,300
options. To add a response option click
add item.

50
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,730
When you've completed the form, click
Save.

51
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,080
If you need to edit the items or you
want to remove it, click on the expansion

52
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,390
arrow to expose the edit and delete
buttons.

53
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:30,860
Repeat this process for every item you
wish to add to the form the third tab in

54
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,020
the wizard is the preview form.
Clicking on it will show you what your

55
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,030
review form will look like to those
using it.

56
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,500
This can help you tweak the item type
and ensure that the form you're creating

57
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,120
matches with your use intentions of the
form. To close the wizard, return to the

58
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,130
review form tab
and click Save at the bottom. When your

59
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:59,520
form is ready to be used
be sure to check the active button.

60
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:06,539
If your Journal is using blind review,
enable the function to send relevant

61
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:10,620
instructions and information. Clicking on
the hyperlink text will open a window

62
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,939
with more information about this feature.
Competing interest is an area where you

63
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,960
can define your journals competing
interest disclosure policy. It is a rich

64
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,279
text editor and you can customize this
section as best serves you. If you

65
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,819
require a competing interest statement
from the reviewer, tick this box.

66
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,810
The review guideline section is a space
in which you can define what is expected

67
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,800
of your reviewers provide them with
review criteria to help them assess the

68
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,820
submission and any guidelines or
policies that would help reviewers

69
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,400
complete their work such as that
deadlines to accept review or the

70
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,320
deadline to submit their review. It is a
rich text editor and you can complete it

71
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,730
as best suits your journal.
Following you can select whether the

72
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:02,790
review process will be double-blind,
blind or open using the drop-down menu.

73
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:09,100
Finally, we come to reviewer access which tweaks how and when reviewers can access

74
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,510
submissions they have been asked to review.
If you would like to either enable one,

75
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,830
click review access or stipulate that
reviewers must agree to review before

76
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:22,900
they are able to access submission files.
Tick the appropriate boxes. When you've

77
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,370
completed the settings to your
satisfaction, click Save. This concludes

78
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,300
our overview of the review workflow
settings. Thanks for watching and we'll

79
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,320
see you again in the next module.
